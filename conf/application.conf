# This is the main configuration file for the application.

# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
#
# This must be changed for production, but we recommend not changing it in this file.
#
# See http://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/ApplicationSecret for more details.

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
play.i18n.langs = [ "en" ]

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# play.http.router = my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
db.default.driver=org.postgresql.Driver
db.default.user="helin"
db.default.pass="helin"
db.default.url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5455/helin"
# db.default.username=sa
# db.default.password=""
#
# You can expose this datasource via JNDI if needed (Useful for JPA)
db.default.jndiName=DefaultDS

jpa.default=defaultPersistenceUnit

# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
play.evolutions.enabled=true
# We use PostgreSQL which supports DDL transaction
play.evolutions.autocommit=false
